# SimpleCSSSite

This is a simple HTML and CSS website for a fictional dry cleaning business located in Metropolis. 

## Tech Used

I only used HTML and CSS to build this simple website.

## Lessons Learned

I built this project specifically to practice using CSS without a framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap, as well as to get more comfortable using media queries to resize the content for different screen sizes.

This project also gave me a chance to review flex box basics and get more comfortable building layouts from scratch.
